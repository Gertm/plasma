== General Project Style Guide

* Any user-visible changes such as new compiler options or new features
  should be documented.  Any major new features should be documented to be
  included with release notes.  This is especially important for anything
  that might cause anyone's existing code to break.

* Anything affecting high-level design should be
  documented in `docs/design.html'.

== Mercury Code Style Guide

=== Documentation


* Each module should contain header comments which state the module's name,
  a copyright notice, license info, main author(s), and purpose, and give an
  overview of what the module does, what are the major algorithms and data
  structures it uses, etc.

* Everything that is exported from a module should have sufficient documentation that it can be understood without reference to the module's implementation section.

* Each predicate other than trivial access predicates should have a short comment describing what the predicate is supposed to do, and what the meaning of the arguments are. Ideally this description should also note any conditions under which the predicate can fail or throw an exception.

* There should be a comment for each field of a structure saying what the field represents.

=== Naming

* Variables should always be given meaningful names, unless they are irrelevant to the code in question. For example, it is OK to use single-character names in an access predicate which just sets a single field of a structure, such as:

----
bar_set_foo(Foo, bar(A, B, C, _, E), bar(A, B, C, Foo, E)).
----

* Variables which represent different states or different versions of the same entity should be named Foo0, Foo1, Foo2, ..., Foo.
* Predicates which get or set a field of a structure or ADT should be named bar_get_foo and bar_set_foo respectively, where bar is the name of the structure or ADT and foo is the name of the field.

=== Coding

* Your code should make as much reuse of existing code as possible. "cut-and-paste" style reuse is highly discouraged.

* No fixed limits please! (If you really must have a fixed limit, include detailed documentation explaining why it was so hard to avoid.)

=== Error handling

* Code should check for both erroneous inputs from the user and also invalid
  data being passed from other modules. You should also always check to make
  sure that the routines that you call have succeeded; make sure you don't
  silently ignore failures. (This last point almost goes without saying in
  Mercury, but is particularly important to bear in mind if you are writing
  any C code or shell scripts, or if you are interfacing with the OS.)

* Calls to error/1 should always indicate an internal software error, not
  merely incorrect inputs from the user, or failure of some library routine
  or system call.

* Error messages should follow a consistent format. For compiler error
  messages, each line should start with the source file name and line number
  in "%s:%03d: " format. Error messages should be complete
  sentences.  For error messages that are spread over more than one line (as
  are most of them), the second and subsequent lines should be indented two
  spaces.

=== Layout

* Each module should be indented consistently, with 4 spaces per level of
  indentation. The indentation should be consistently done with spaces.
  A tab character should always mean 4 spaces.
  Never under any circumstances mix tabs and spaces.

  Currently 100% of our development is done in vim, therefore it is trivial
  to use an editor hint to encourage this.  Files should have something like
  this at the top, even before the copyright line:

----
	% vim: ft=mercury ts=4 sw=4 et
----

  Hints for other editors should be added as necessary.

* No line should extend beyond 77 characters.  We choose 77 characters to
  allow for one character to be used when creating diffs and two more
  characters to be used in e-mail replies duing code review.

* Since "empty" lines that have spaces or tabs on them prevent the proper functioning of paragraph-oriented commands in vi, lines shouldn't have trailing white space. They can be removed with a vi macro such as the following. (Each pair of square brackets contains a space and a tab.)
----
	map ;x :g/[     ][      ]*$/s///^M
----

* String literals that don't fit on a single line should be split by writing them as two or more strings concatenated using the "++" operator; the Mercury compiler will evaluate this at compile time, if --optimize-constant-propagation is enabled (i.e. at -O3 or higher).

* Predicates that have only one mode should use predmode declarations rather than having a separate mode declaration.

* If-then-elses should always be parenthesized, except that an if-then-else that occurs as the else part of another if-then-else doesn't need to be parenthesized. The condition of an if-then-else can either be on the same line as the opening parenthesis and the `->',

----
	( test1 ->
		goal1
	; test2 ->
		goal2
	;
		goal
	)
----

or, if the test is complicated, it can be on a line of its own:

----
	(
		very_long_test_that_does_not_fit_on_one_line(VeryLongArgument1,
			VeryLongArgument2)
	->
		goal1
	;
		test2a,
		test2b,
	->
		goal2
	;
		test3	% would fit one one line, but separate for consistency
	->
		goal3
	;
		goal
	).
----

* Disjunctions should always be parenthesized. The semicolon of a disjunction should never be at the end of a line -- put it at the start of the next line instead.

* Normally disjunctions place each semicolon on a new line

----
    (
        goal1,
        goal2
    ;
        goal3
    ;
        goal4,
        goal5
    ).
----

* However simple disjunctions, such as those that attempt to unify a
  variable in each disjunct (which are also switches), may be formatted more
  concicely.

----
    ( goal1
    ; goal2
    ; goal3
    ),
----

* Switches may be formatted with the switched on variable sharing a line
  with the open-paren and each semicolon:

----
    ( X = foo,
        goal1,
        goal2
    ; X = bar,
        goal3
    ).
----

  Or the switched on variable may have a line of its own, as it would in a
  regular disjunction.

* Predicates and functions implemented via foreign code should be formatted like this:

----
:- pragma foreign_proc("C",
    to_float(IntVal::in, FloatVal::out),
    [will_not_call_mercury, promise_pure],
"
    FloatVal = IntVal;
").
----

* The predicate name and arguments should be on a line on their own, as should the list of annotations. The foreign code should also be on lines of its own; it shouldn't share lines with the double quote marks surrounding it.
* Type definitions should be formatted in one of the following styles:

----
    :- type my_type
        --->    my_type(
                    some_other_type    % comment explaining it
                ).

	:- type some_other_type == int.

    :- type foo
        --->    bar(
                    int,        % comment explaining it
                    float       % comment explaining it
                )
        ;       baz
        ;       quux.
----

* If an individual clause is long, it should be broken into sections, and each section should have a "block comment" describing what it does; blank lines should be used to show the separation into sections. Comments should precede the code to which they apply, rather than following it.

----
	%
	% This is a block comment; it applies to the code in the next
	% section (up to the next blank line).
	%
	blah,
	blah,
	blahblah,
	blah,
----

If a particular line or two needs explanation, a "line" comment

----
	% This is a "line" comment; it applies to the next line or two
	% of code
	blahblah
or an "inline" comment
	blahblah	% This is an "inline" comment
----

should be used.

=== Structuring

* Code should generally be arranged so that procedures (or types, etc.) are listed in top-down order, not bottom-up.
* Code should be grouped into bunches of related predicates, functions, etc., and sections of code that are conceptually separate should be separated with dashed lines:

----
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%
----

Ideally such sections should be identified by "section heading" comments identifying the contents of the section, optionally followed by a more detailed description. These should be laid out like this:

----
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%
% Section title
%

% Detailed description of the contents of the section and/or
% general comments about the contents of the section.
% This part may go one for several lines.
%
% It can even contain several paragraphs.

The actual code starts here.
----

For example

----
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%
% Exception handling
%

% This section contains all the code that deals with throwing or catching
% exceptions, including saving and restoring the virtual machine registers
% if necessary.
%
% Note that we need to take care to ensure that this code is thread-safe!

:- type foo
    ---> ...

----

Double-dashed lines, i.e.

----
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%
----

can also be used to indicate divisions into major sections. Note that these
dividing lines should not exceed the 77 character limit (see above).

=== Module imports

* Each group of :- import_module items should list only one module per line,
  since this makes it much easier to read diffs that change the set of
  imported modules. In the compiler, when e.g. an interface section imports
  modules from from the same program (the compiler) and other libraries,
  there should be two groups of imports, the imports from the program first
  and then the ones from the libraries.
* Each group of import_module items should be sorted, since this makes it
  easier to detect duplicate imports and missing imports. It also groups
  together the imported modules from the same package. There should be no
  blank lines between the imports of modules from different packages, since
  this makes it harder to resort the group with a single editor command.

== C Coding Standard for the Plasma Language Project

These coding guidelines are presented in the briefest manner possible and therefore do not include rationales.
Because the coding standard has been kept deliberately brief, there are some items missing that would be included in a more comprehensive standard. For more on commonsense C programming, consult the Indian Hill C coding standard or the comp.lang.c FAQ.

=== File organization

==== Modules and interfaces

* We impose a discipline on C to allow us to emulate (poorly) the modules of languages such as Ada and Modula-3.
* Every .c file has a corresponding .h file with the same base name. For example, list.c and list.h.
* We consider the .c file to be the module's implementation and the .h file to be the module's interface. We'll just use the terms `source file' and `header'.
* All items exported from a source file must be declared in the header. These items include functions, variables, #defines, typedefs, enums, structs, and so on. In short, an item is anything that doesn't allocate storage. Qualify function prototypes with the `extern' keyword. Also, do qualify each variable declaration with the `extern' keyword, otherwise storage for the variable will be allocated in every source file that includes the header containing the variable definition.
* We import a module by including its header. Never give extern declarations for imported functions in source files. Always include the header of the module instead.
* Each header must #include any other headers on which it depends. Hence it's imperative every header be protected against multiple inclusion. Also, take care to avoid circular dependencies.
* Always include system headers using the angle brackets syntax, rather than
  double quotes. That is #include <stdio.h> . Plasma-specific headers
  should be included using the double quotes syntax. That is #include
  "pz_run.h" Do not put root-relative or `..'-relative directories
  in #includes.

==== Organization within a file

===== Source files

Items in source files should in general be in this order:

. Prologue comment describing the module.
. #includes of system headers (such as stdio.h and unistd.h)
. #includes of headers specific to this project.
. Any local #defines.
. Definitions of any local (that is, file-static) global variables.
. Prototypes for any local (that is, file-static) functions.
. Definitions of functions.

Within each section, items should generally be listed in top-down order, not
bottom-up. That is, if foo() calls bar(), then the definition of foo()
should precede the definition of bar().

===== Header files

Items in headers should in general be in this order:
typedefs, structs, unions, enums,
extern variable declarations,
function prototypes then
#defines
However, it is probably more important to group items which are conceptually
related than to follow this order strictly. Also note that #defines which
define configuration macros used for conditional compilation or which define
constants that are used for array sizes will need to come before the code
that uses them. But in general configuration macros should be isolated in
separate files.

Every header should be protected against multiple inclusion using the following idiom:

[source,c]
----
#ifndef MODULE_H
#define	MODULE_H

/* body of module.h */

#endif	/* ! MODULE_H */
----

=== Comments

==== What should be commented

===== Functions

Each function should have a one-line description of what it does. Additionally, both the inputs and outputs (including pass-by-pointer) should be described. Any side-effects not passing through the explicit inputs and outputs should be described. If any memory is allocated, you should describe who is responsible for deallocation. If memory can change upon successive invocations (such as function-static data), mention it. If memory should not be deallocated by anyone (such as constant string literals), mention this.

===== Macros

Each non-trivial macro should be documented just as for functions (see above). It is also a good idea to document the types of macro arguments and return values, e.g. by including a function declaration in a comment.

===== Headers

Such function comments should be present in header files for each function exported from a source file. Ideally, a client of the module should not have to look at the implementation, only the interface. In C terminology, the header should suffice for working out how an exported function works.

===== Source files

Every source file should have a prologue comment which includes:
Copyright notice.
License info (e.g. GPL or LGPL).
Short description of the purpose of the module.
Any design information or other details required to understand and maintain the module.

===== Global variables

Any global variable should be excruciatingly documented. This is especially true when globals are exported from a module. In general, there are very few circumstances that justify use of a global.

==== Comment style

Use comments of this form:
[source,c]
----
/*
 * Here is a comment.
 * And here's some more comment.
 */
----
For annotations to a single line of code:
[source,c]
----
i += 3; /* Here's a comment about this line of code. */
----

==== Guidelines for comments

===== Revisits

Any code that needs to be revisited because it is a temporary hack (or some other expediency) must have a comment of the form:
	/*
	 * XXX: <reason for revisit>
	 */
The <reason for revisit> should explain the problem in a way that can be understood by developers other than the author of the comment.

===== Comments on preprocessor statements

The #ifdef constructs should be commented like so if they extend for more than a few lines of code:
[source,c]
----
#ifdef SOME_VAR
	/*...*/
#else	/* ! SOME_VAR */
	/*...*/
#endif	/* ! SOME_VAR */
----

Similarly for #ifndef.
Use the GNU convention of comments that indicate whether the variable is true in the #if and #else parts of an #ifdef or #ifndef. For instance:
[source,c]
----
#ifdef SOME_VAR
#endif /* SOME_VAR */

#ifdef SOME_VAR
	/*...*/
#else /* ! SOME_VAR */
	/*...*/
#endif /* ! SOME_VAR */

#ifndef SOME_VAR
	/*...*/
#else	/* SOME_VAR */
	/*...*/
#endif	/* SOME_VAR */
----

=== Declarations

==== Pointer declarations

Attach the pointer qualifier to the variable name.
[source,c]
----
char	*str1, *str2;
----
==== Static and extern declarations

Limit module exports to the absolute essentials. Make as much static (that is, local) as possible since this keeps interfaces to modules simpler.

==== Typedefs

Use typedefs to make code self-documenting. They are especially useful on structs, unions, and enums.
=== Naming conventions

==== Functions, function-like macros, and variables

Use all lowercase with underscores to separate words. For instance,
soul_machine.

==== Enumeration constants, #define constants, and non-function-like macros

Use all uppercase with underscores to separate words. For instance,
MAX_HEADROOM.

==== Typedefs

Use first letter uppercase for each word, other letters lowercase and
underscores to separate words. For instance, Directory_Entry.

==== Structs and unions

If something is both a struct and a typedef, the name for the struct should
be formed by appending `_Struct' to the typedef name:

[source,c]
----
typedef struct Directory_Entry_Struct {
	...
} DirectoryEntry;
----
For unions, append `_Union' to the typedef name.

=== Syntax and layout

==== Minutiae

Use 4 spaces to a tab. No line should be longer than 77 characters. If a
statement is too long, continue it on the next line indented two levels
deeper. If the statement extends over more than two lines, then make sure
the subsequent lines are indented to the same depth as the second line. For
example:
[source,c]
----
here = is_a_really_long_statement_that_does_not_fit +
		on_one_line + in_fact_it_doesnt_even_fit +
		on_two_lines;
if (this_is_a_somewhat_long_conditional_test(
		in_the_condition_of_an +
		if_then))
{
	/*...*/
}
----	

==== Statements

Use one statement per line. Here are example layout styles for the various syntactic constructs:

===== If statement

Use the "/* end if */" comment if the if statement is larger than a page.
[source,c]
----
/*
 * Curlies are placed in a K&R-ish manner.
 * And comments look like this.
 */
if (blah) {
	/*
     * Always use curlies, even when there's only
	 * one statement in the block.
	 */
} else {
	/* ... */
} /* end if */

/*
 * if the condition is so long that the open curly doesn't
 * fit on the same line as the `if', put it on a line of
 * its own
 */
if (a_very_long_condition() &&
	another_long_condition_that_forces_a_line_wrap())
{
	/* ... */
}
----

===== Functions

Function names are flush against the left margin. This makes it easier to grep for function definitions (as opposed to their invocations). In argument lists, put space after commas. And use the /* func */ comment when the function is longer than a page.

Unlike other code blocks, the open-curly for a function should be placed on
a new line.

[source,c]
----
int
rhododendron(int a, float b, double c)
{
	/* ... */
} /* end rhododendron() */
----

===== Variables

Variable declarations shouldn't be flush left, however.
[source,c]
----
int x = 0, y = 3, z;

int a[] = {
	1,2,3,4,5
};
----

===== Switches

[source,c]
----
 switch (blah) {
	case BLAH1:
		/*...*/
		break;
	case BLAH2: {
		int i;

		/*...*/
		break;
	}
	default:
		/*...*/
		break;
} /* switch */
----

===== Structs, unions, and enums

[source,c]
----
 struct Point {
	int	tag;
	union 	cool {
		int	ival;
		double	dval;
	} cool;
};
enum Stuff {
	STUFF_A, STUFF_B /*...*/
};
----

===== Loops
[source,c]
----
 while (stuff) {
	/*...*/
}

do {
	/*...*/
} while(stuff)

for (this; that; those) {
	/* Always use curlies, even if no body. */
}

/*
** If no body, do this...
*/
while (stuff)
	{}
for (this; that; those)
	{}
----

==== Preprocessing

===== Nesting

Nested #ifdefs, #ifndefs and #ifs should be indented by two spaces for each
level of nesting. For example:

[source,c]
----
#ifdef GUAVA
  #ifndef PAPAYA
  #else /* PAPAYA */
  #endif /* PAPAYA */
#else /* not GUAVA */
#endif /* not GUAVA */
----

=== Portability

==== Architecture specifics

Avoid relying on properties of a specific machine architecture unless necessary, and if necessary localise such dependencies. One solution is to have architecture-specific macros to hide access to machine-dependent code. Some machine-specific properties are:
Size (in bits) of C built-in data types (short, int, long, float, double).
Byte-order. Big- or little-endian (or other).
Alignment requirements.

==== Operating system specifics

Operating system APIs differ from platform to platform. Although most support standard POSIX calls such as `read', `write' and `unlink', you cannot rely on the presence of, for instance, System V shared memory, or BSD sockets.
Adhere to POSIX-supported operating system calls whenever possible since they are widely supported, even by Windows and VMS.

When POSIX doesn't provide the required functionality, ensure that the operating system specific calls are localized.

==== Compiler and C library specifics

ANSI C compilers are now widespread and hence we needn't pander to old K&R compilers. However compilers (in particular the GNU C compiler) often provide non-ANSI extensions. Ensure that any use of compiler extensions is localised and protected by #ifdefs.
Don't rely on features whose behaviour is undefined according to the ANSI C standard. For that matter, don't rely on C arcana even if they are defined. For instance, setjmp/longjmp and ANSI signals often have subtle differences in behaviour between platforms.
(We assume a C11 compiler is available.)

If you write threaded code, make sure any non-reentrant code is appropriately protected via mutual exclusion. The biggest cause of non-reentrant (non-thread-safe) code is function-static data. Note that some C library functions may be non-reentrant. This may or may not be documented in the man pages.

==== Environment specifics

This is one of the most important sections in the coding standard. Here we
mention what other tools Plasma may depend on.

===== Tools required for Plasma

In order to build Plasma you need:
* A POSIX (2-1992) system/environment.
* A shell compatible with Bourne shell (sh)
* GNU make
One of:
* A C11 compiler
* Mercury, the latest stable release does not work, 2015-07-01 works.

==== Documenting the tools

If further tools or libraries are required, you should add them to the above
list. And similarly, if you eliminate dependence on a tool, remove it from
the above list.

=== Coding specifics

Do not assume arbitrary limits in data structures. Don't just allocate `lots' and hope that's enough. Either it's too much or it will eventually hit the wall and have to be debugged. Using high-water-marking is one possible solution for strings, for instance.
Always check return values when they exist,
Always give prototypes (function declarations) for functions. When the prototype is in a header, import the header; do not write the prototype for an extern function.
Stick to C11 whenever possible. Stick to POSIX when C11 doesn't provide what you need. Avoid platform specific code unless necessary.
Use signals with extreme austerity. They are messy and subject to platform idiosyncrasies even within POSIX.
Don't assume the sizes of C data types. Don't assume the byte-order of the platform.
Prefer enums to lists of #defines. Note that enums constants are of type int, hence if you want an enumeration of chars or shorts, then you must use lists of #defines.
Parameters to macros should be in parentheses.

team, not necessarily the opinion of any single author. It is based on the
"Coding Standard for the Mercury Project".
