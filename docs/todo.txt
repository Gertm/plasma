While the roadmap on the website provides an overview of the project's
progress.  This file lists specific tasks, and is more-or-less an aide to
memory.

== TODO Items

=== General

* Add contact us page/URL that can be referred to easily from other
  places.
* Update style guide for better vim settings based on work discussion
* Compare and make notes about process calculi

=== pzrun

* Allow mutual references (need to preparse the whole file, not just a
  procedure at a time.
* strength reduction optimisations (peek 1 -> dup and roll 2 -> swap)

=== Semantic analysis

* Type checking
* Resource usage checking
* Expression arity checking
* Variable scope check: cannot bind in some expression contextx like the
  arguments of a call.
* Variable scope check: variables visible outside of a ITE/Switch arm must
  be bound an all execution paths.


== Ideas to consider

GC::
  * Regions
  * Mark-compact for acyclic objects
