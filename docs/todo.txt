While the roadmap on the website provides an overview of the project's
progress.  This file lists specific tasks, and is more-or-less an aide to
memory.

== TODO Items

These items are things that can be done almost right away.  They don't have
anything major blocking them and won't distract from the roadmap too much.

=== Bugs

=== Non-code tasks

* Update style guide for better vim settings based on work discussion
* Compare and make notes about process calculi

=== pzrun

* Allow mutual references (works for procedures but not for data).

=== plasmac

* Generate compiler errors rather than throw exceptions
* Create a new exception type for compile errors that are currently handled as
  exceptions and use it instead of other exception types.  Eventually these
  should not be exceptions at all.

==== Semantic analysis

* Type errors
* Check that a statement does not use any resouce more than once, including
  related resources.
* Resource usage checking
* Variable scope check: cannot bind in some expression contexts like the
  arguments of a call.
* Variable scope check: variables visible outside of an ITE/Switch arm must
  be bound on all execution paths.
* function parameters are named apart check.

=== PZ format & machine

* How will modules and namespaces work?

=== pzasm

== TODO later tasks

These tasks should not be done now.  They're either blocked by something
major or would distract from more immediate goals.

=== Relax the Plasma language

* Currently procedures require a type signature, allow inference for
  module-local procedures.
* Currently diverging code (cases, ITE) all branches must either "return" or
  not return.  This should be relaxed.

== Ideas to consider

GC::
  * Regions
  * Mark-compact for acyclic objects
