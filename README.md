Plasma Language
===============

Plasma is a new programming language.


Dependencies
------------

You will need:
    A C compiler, I've been testing with GCC.  Clang should also work.

    Mercury, the latest stable release does not work, I've been using
    rotd-2015-07-01

Usage
-----

Type "make"

You should get src/pzasm and runtime/pzrun.  Neither of them do anything of
interest yet.
